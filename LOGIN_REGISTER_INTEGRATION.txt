Login & Registration Integration Guide:

- Added templates: login.html, register.html, base.html to app/templates/
- Copied static assets (CSS, JS, images) from Endterm/app/static/
- Integrate routes manually if needed:
    Add login/register routes from Endterm/app/routes.py into app/controllers/auth_controller.py
    Ensure 'User' model and 'forms.py' have matching fields for username/email/password.
    Use session-based login (Flask-Login or session) to protect routes.

All assets and structure are now merged for final integration testing.
